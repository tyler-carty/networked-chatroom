# networked-chatroom
 
A simple networked application that makes use of OOP, concurrent programming techniques and networked libraries to provide a networked chatroom for communication between devices.

This project was built using Python and its socket/tkinter library to allow for networked features and a GUI.

To run, start a server.py on a machine (making note of the IP shown).
Then, run a client and enter the IP of the server as well as a name choice once the connection is confirmed.

Please note, this will only work on local networks (not over the internet) unless the network port is forwarded and you enter the public IP of the server machine.

Thank You!
